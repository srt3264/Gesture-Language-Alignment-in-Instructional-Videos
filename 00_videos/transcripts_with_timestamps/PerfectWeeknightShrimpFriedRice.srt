1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.800
See, that's great, that's what we want.

2
00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:03.960
Oops, shrimp overboard.

3
00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:06.560
Who wants to catch this in their mouth?

4
00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:08.760
That's good.

5
00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:09.600
That's good.

6
00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:10.440
That's good.

7
00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:12.680
Hi, I'm Eric Kim.

8
00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:14.800
I'm a cooking columnist for The New York Times.

9
00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:17.280
Today we're gonna make a very, very simple

10
00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:21.280
but effective shrimp fried rice with yum yum sauce.

11
00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:28.620
This recipe is sort of inspired by

12
00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:31.220
Connie House in Atlanta, Georgia.

13
00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:34.780
And I sort of describe it as the Benihana of my hometown.

14
00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:37.980
And every time I go back home,

15
00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:41.260
I kind of crave that hibachi flavor.

16
00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:45.620
The way they cook with that high heat is so special.

17
00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:48.580
It's a really special way to cook vegetables, rice, shrimp.

18
00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:50.300
So this recipe is inspired by that.

19
00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:52.340
We're gonna make a shrimp fried rice

20
00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:54.580
and then we're gonna make the yum yum sauce

21
00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:58.340
and just jackson pollock it all over the rice at the end.

22
00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:03.180
It's just a really over the top way to enjoy

23
00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:06.900
something that is ordinarily quite simple.

24
00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:09.420
I've got a large nonstick skillet.

25
00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:10.540
It's the largest I've got.

26
00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:12.540
If you have a cast iron skillet that works really well,

27
00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:13.980
like a nice seasoned one.

28
00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:18.240
And I'm actually just using frozen peeled and deveined shrimp.

29
00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:20.100
With something as quick cooking as shrimp,

30
00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:21.040
it kind of doesn't matter.

31
00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:23.100
This is smoking, which actually is a good sign.

32
00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:26.220
The goal is to imbue the oil with shrimp flavor

33
00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:28.660
and that oil will flavor the rest of the dish.

34
00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:33.660
Season with salt, garlic powder.

35
00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:37.620
I love garlic powder.

36
00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:40.860
The garlic powder is because I don't feel like

37
00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:42.180
chopping garlic.

38
00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:44.780
The reason I'm cooking the shrimp first

39
00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:48.140
is because I wanna get it just until it's like perfectly

40
00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:50.380
cooked, but if I were to add it with the rice

41
00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:53.860
and frying the hot rice with everything at the end,

42
00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:55.940
it would make the shrimp overcooked.

43
00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:58.420
And so what you're doing is you're just folding it in

44
00:01:58.420 --> 00:01:59.260
at the end.

45
00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:01.740
While that's going, I'm going to chop my onion.

46
00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:04.660
I love onion in my fried rice.

47
00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:05.940
I don't know, I just, I like,

48
00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:08.500
I like when it's barely cooked actually.

49
00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:10.140
You know, just like chunks of it.

50
00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:14.140
You're almost deep frying them, you know?

51
00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:18.980
Okay, pretty happy with that.

52
00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:25.180
Slotted spoon, I just wanna remove them.

53
00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:29.180
You have all this incredible shrimp oil.

54
00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:31.900
Sokidem is what my mom would call it.

55
00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:33.500
Anyway, this is the shrimp oil.

56
00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:35.820
We're gonna finish our fried rice in it now.

57
00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:37.820
We're gonna fry the onion and stuff.

58
00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:40.540
Frozen mixed vegetables.

59
00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:44.460
I think a lot of people use them.

60
00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:45.660
I grew up using them.

61
00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:47.220
I always have these in my freezer.

62
00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:49.820
I'm gonna add a cup and a half to the hot pan.

63
00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:55.580
You know, these vegetables, they're all kind of sweet.

64
00:02:55.580 --> 00:03:00.580
And they also cook and thaw at the same rate.

65
00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:02.740
I think that's why they work really well.

66
00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:04.340
I'm also gonna add the onion now.

67
00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:07.700
And I like when my onion is barely cooked.

68
00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:09.420
It doesn't have its raw edge anymore.

69
00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:12.420
It's been slightly tempered by the heat.

70
00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:14.340
And so right now, we're really just trying to thaw it.

71
00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:15.460
Get it less raw.

72
00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:17.140
And we're gonna add the rice pretty soon now.

73
00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:18.940
One thing that is important to know

74
00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:21.380
about frozen vegetables is they're already cooked.

75
00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:22.260
They're blanched.

76
00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:23.940
They're picked right when they're like perfect.

77
00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:26.340
It's not actually that you're cooking the vegetables.

78
00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:27.180
They're already cooked.

79
00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:29.980
You are just thawing them basically now.

80
00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:30.980
And on top of everything,

81
00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:33.980
it's cooking in that glorious shrimp oil, right?

82
00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:37.340
And so I'm also gonna season a little with salt.

83
00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:39.740
I don't want the onion to cook too much.

84
00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:42.140
So this is actually looking good to me.

85
00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:45.740
As it's going, I'm gonna grab the rice.

86
00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:48.580
I'm adding six cups of cooked white rice.

87
00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:49.900
So that's six.

88
00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:52.300
This is, I'm just gonna add it all.

89
00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:53.760
So our sauce goes in.

90
00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:55.640
And you know, the soy sauce is by taste,

91
00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:57.360
but I have measurements in the recipe

92
00:03:57.360 --> 00:03:59.800
so that you have a place to start.

93
00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:01.840
This is what my mom does.

94
00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:06.840
It's the mom, two spoon, two spatula, like toss.

95
00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:10.600
One of the first things I ever made was fried rice.

96
00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:12.520
It was home at class in fifth grade.

97
00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:14.400
The teacher was teaching fried rice

98
00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:16.960
and her fried rice recipe was so weird to me

99
00:04:16.960 --> 00:04:19.280
because it had like uncle Ben's white rice

100
00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:22.080
and like canned cheese and carrots

101
00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:24.160
and then like soy sauce and that's it.

102
00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:26.120
Now remember we made it and I ate it

103
00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:28.800
and I was like, why does it taste so bad?

104
00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:30.480
Even when I made it at home, I was like, okay,

105
00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:32.080
how do I make it taste more like my mom's

106
00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:35.040
or like the fried rice as I grew up loving.

107
00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:37.600
And I kind of learned later

108
00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:40.800
that it really does have to do with the high heat.

109
00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:44.200
My mom always calls it poon mat fire taste.

110
00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:47.560
What I'm actually gonna do is leave it now.

111
00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:48.880
Just really let it go.

112
00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:51.400
This will take about like five or so minutes.

113
00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:55.080
Oh, that's a good, you see that?

114
00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:56.360
That's like a good sign.

115
00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:58.760
I never thought I would be showing people

116
00:04:58.760 --> 00:04:59.640
how to make fried rice.

117
00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:01.720
It's just like not something I've ever thought

118
00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:02.920
to write a recipe for.

119
00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:04.880
I don't know, it's always just,

120
00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:06.440
this is just like kind of what I eat.

121
00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:08.680
You know, it's what I make for myself with leftover rice

122
00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:11.160
and sometimes when I'm just craving it.

123
00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:13.400
We can add our eggs now.

124
00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:14.880
I think a lot of people add the,

125
00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:16.520
they scrambled the egg first actually

126
00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:18.840
and then they add the rice and the vegetables and all that

127
00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:21.960
but I scooched it all over to one side

128
00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.200
and this is a way to just make sure you're only,

129
00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:27.280
you're cooking the egg just until it's set.

130
00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:29.680
You know, like I like a soft set scramble

131
00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:31.800
and in this empty space,

132
00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:33.680
I'm adding two tablespoons of butter.

133
00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:36.100
While doing this also,

134
00:05:36.100 --> 00:05:38.260
the fried rice continues to crisp, you know,

135
00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:41.160
as it's like waiting for you to do this egg part

136
00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:43.740
which is only gonna take a minute.

137
00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:48.280
I like a lot of egg to rice personally.

138
00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:50.600
So this recipe calls for four eggs.

139
00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:53.160
Sort of this is my scrambled egg method in general

140
00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:56.520
but just really break up the yolks

141
00:05:56.520 --> 00:05:58.440
and really like scramble it

142
00:05:58.440 --> 00:06:00.880
just until it's pretty set

143
00:06:00.880 --> 00:06:04.080
but not hard and rubbery, you know.

144
00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:07.000
It's this like vigorous stirring of the egg

145
00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:08.480
that will make it really fluffy

146
00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:11.440
and it will make the curds pretty like soft set

147
00:06:11.440 --> 00:06:13.200
which I think is lovely.

148
00:06:13.200 --> 00:06:14.760
You need to cook it enough

149
00:06:14.760 --> 00:06:16.320
before you fold it back into the rice

150
00:06:16.320 --> 00:06:20.280
because you don't want the rice to get all like gunky.

151
00:06:20.280 --> 00:06:21.120
Okay, this is perfect.

152
00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:21.960
Off the heat.

153
00:06:21.960 --> 00:06:24.280
I'm gonna fold it into the egg.

154
00:06:24.280 --> 00:06:25.220
Actually, this is the step

155
00:06:25.220 --> 00:06:27.040
at which I would just add back the shrimp

156
00:06:27.040 --> 00:06:28.960
and then now you're just mixing.

157
00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:30.440
You know, I don't want the egg to cook anymore.

158
00:06:30.440 --> 00:06:32.160
I don't want the shrimp to cook anymore.

159
00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:33.320
I'm really just doing this now.

160
00:06:33.320 --> 00:06:35.360
Ooh, that's gorgeous actually.

161
00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:37.340
When I developed this recipe,

162
00:06:37.340 --> 00:06:38.680
I made so many versions

163
00:06:38.680 --> 00:06:42.240
and they all kind of tasted too boring for some reason.

164
00:06:42.240 --> 00:06:43.920
That's where the yum yum sauce comes in.

165
00:06:43.920 --> 00:06:45.480
Yum yum sauce is usually served

166
00:06:45.480 --> 00:06:49.480
at Japanese American restaurants and steak houses

167
00:06:49.480 --> 00:06:53.200
similar to mayo based kind of ketchup sauces.

168
00:06:53.200 --> 00:06:57.660
Dehydrated garlic, AKA garlic powder and sweet paprika.

169
00:06:57.660 --> 00:06:59.320
They can get a little grainy

170
00:06:59.320 --> 00:07:01.440
and so I think it's a really good idea

171
00:07:01.440 --> 00:07:06.440
to first mix them with a little bit of warm water.

172
00:07:06.680 --> 00:07:09.880
Water from a recently boiled kettle is like good enough.

173
00:07:09.880 --> 00:07:10.960
Almost like hydrating it

174
00:07:10.960 --> 00:07:13.160
so that it's not so grainy in the final product.

175
00:07:13.160 --> 00:07:16.680
And then we're gonna do about half a cup of mayonnaise

176
00:07:16.680 --> 00:07:18.120
and a quarter cup of ketchup,

177
00:07:18.120 --> 00:07:20.440
a little bit of rice vinegar.

178
00:07:20.440 --> 00:07:24.080
You want a little bit of balance in the form of sourness

179
00:07:24.080 --> 00:07:26.680
and I like to add a little toasted sesame oil.

180
00:07:26.680 --> 00:07:27.520
It's my touch.

181
00:07:27.520 --> 00:07:29.160
It's sort of this nuttiness

182
00:07:29.160 --> 00:07:30.640
that really rounds out the sauce

183
00:07:30.640 --> 00:07:32.960
and it kind of makes you...

184
00:07:32.960 --> 00:07:35.400
Sorry.

185
00:07:35.400 --> 00:07:36.240
You want a little runny.

186
00:07:36.240 --> 00:07:38.000
That's another thing about the water.

187
00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:39.240
It kind of thins it out.

188
00:07:39.240 --> 00:07:40.560
You know, you could even thin it out further

189
00:07:40.560 --> 00:07:43.400
if you would like, but I'm pretty happy with this.

190
00:07:43.400 --> 00:07:46.720
That's really gonna like, I think, bring us home.

191
00:07:46.720 --> 00:07:49.040
Okay, yum yum sauce is done.

192
00:07:49.040 --> 00:07:49.880
It's very yummy.

193
00:07:49.880 --> 00:07:50.920
The fried rice is done.

194
00:07:50.920 --> 00:07:52.720
It's got a little crispiness on the bottom

195
00:07:52.720 --> 00:07:56.280
because we let it sit while I finish the sauce.

196
00:07:56.280 --> 00:07:59.200
This is the part where I'm just gonna go for it.

197
00:08:00.720 --> 00:08:01.880
It's really over the top.

198
00:08:01.880 --> 00:08:06.640
But it's something that I really love.

199
00:08:06.640 --> 00:08:08.320
You don't have to do the yum yum,

200
00:08:08.320 --> 00:08:11.400
but it's pretty awesome with the rice, you know?

201
00:08:16.840 --> 00:08:20.200
It was a taste of the, you know, the fire

202
00:08:20.200 --> 00:08:22.000
because we did high heat

203
00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:24.360
and then a little piece of shrimp

204
00:08:24.360 --> 00:08:25.560
with some yum yum sauce.

205
00:08:25.560 --> 00:08:26.600
Oh, that's egg.

206
00:08:26.600 --> 00:08:27.600
That's a nice bite.

207
00:08:28.960 --> 00:08:30.480
Cooking the shrimp separately like that

208
00:08:30.480 --> 00:08:33.960
is really important because it's cooked just right now.

209
00:08:33.960 --> 00:08:36.080
It started the dish and ends the dish

210
00:08:36.080 --> 00:08:38.360
and that's why I love this recipe.

211
00:08:38.360 --> 00:08:40.040
And the fried rice tastes like

212
00:08:40.040 --> 00:08:42.400
exactly how I think fried rice should taste, so.
