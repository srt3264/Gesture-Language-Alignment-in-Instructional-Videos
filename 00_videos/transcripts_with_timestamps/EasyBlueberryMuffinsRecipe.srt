Hey guys, I'm Dina from SimplyHomeCook.com and today I'll be showing how to make these fluffy and moist blueberry muffins.

2
00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:13.160
They're loaded with a ton of blueberries and they're topped the simple and delicious brown sugar streusel.

3
00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:16.640
So you want to start off by combining all of your dry ingredients.

4
00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:21.960
So in a large bowl combine two cups of all-purpose flour, a teaspoon of baking powder,

5
00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:26.600
half a teaspoon of baking soda, and a quarter teaspoon of salt.

6
00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:31.760
Then whisk it all together and reserve one tablespoon of that flour mixture.

7
00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:38.840
Now mix that reserved tablespoon of the flour mixture with one and a half cups of fresh blueberries.

8
00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:44.040
The reason why we add that little tiny bit of flour to those blueberries is when we add them to the batter,

9
00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:47.840
during baking the blueberries don't sink as fast when they're coated in flour.

10
00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:52.880
Now add three eggs into a large bowl and whisk them on high speed using an electric mixer.

11
00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:57.280
So you want to do this for about three minutes until the eggs become fluffy and pale.

12
00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:02.480
Then continue beating the eggs as you slowly add one cup of granulated sugar.

13
00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:08.280
You want to keep beating those eggs for about three more minutes.

14
00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:11.720
So the key to really fluffy muffins is well beaten eggs.

15
00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:16.960
Now you want to add a teaspoon of vanilla extract and a tablespoon of fresh lemon juice.

16
00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:23.960
Now continue beating the egg mixture as you slowly add three quarter cups of heavy cream.

17
00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:30.960
Now you can begin adding your dry ingredients, but don't do it all at once.

18
00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:36.960
So get a sifter out and then add about a third of that flour mixture at a time with mixing in between.

19
00:01:46.960 --> 00:02:03.960
Once you've got all of your dry ingredients well combined into the muffin batter, continue beating with your electric mixer as you slowly gradually add in four tablespoons of melted unsalted butter.

20
00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:12.960
Alright, now the last and final step is adding in those blueberries.

21
00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:15.960
And at this point you want to fold it in with a spatula.

22
00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:21.960
Now line your muffin tin with cupcake liners and begin scooping the batter out using a large cookie scoop.

23
00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:27.960
I like to top my blueberry muffins with a few extra blueberries on top, but that's totally optional.

24
00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:32.960
And before the muffins go into the oven, you want to make that simple streusel.

25
00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:44.960
In a small bowl, combine one tablespoon of unsalted cold cubed butter, two tablespoons of all-purpose flour, a pinch of salt, a teaspoon of cinnamon, and three tablespoons of brown sugar.

26
00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:51.960
Mash that all together using a fork until the ingredients are well combined and they have a crumbly texture to them.

27
00:02:53.960 --> 00:03:00.960
Now top the blueberry muffins with the streusel topping and bake them in the oven at 350 degrees Fahrenheit for about 35 minutes.

28
00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:20.960
