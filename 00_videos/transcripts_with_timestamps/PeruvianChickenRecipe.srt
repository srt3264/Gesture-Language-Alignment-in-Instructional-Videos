1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.340
When the blender purrs, your sauce is ready.

2
00:00:06.340 --> 00:00:12.220
Smoking like a cat owner, right?

3
00:00:12.220 --> 00:00:17.260
Hi, I'm Melissa Clark, and I'm here in the NIT cooking studio kitchen to make Peruvian

4
00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:18.260
chicken.

5
00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:20.580
In Peru, they don't call it Peruvian chicken, obviously.

6
00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:25.140
Peruvian chicken is the American term for what's basically a spit roasted chicken that

7
00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:27.100
you find all over Latin America.

8
00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:30.540
The key to making this chicken at home in your oven is to use really high heat.

9
00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:35.500
What you're trying to do is get a burnished crisp skin, which is the hallmark of a delicious

10
00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:39.580
Peruvian chicken.

11
00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:44.980
What makes Peruvian chicken specific is that the chilies that it's marinated in come from

12
00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:45.980
Peru.

13
00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:49.780
There are two distinct kinds, ahi amarillo and ahi panca.

14
00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:55.820
In order to get the sort of grilled vibe of the chicken, you don't want to cook it whole.

15
00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:57.460
You want to cut it in half.

16
00:00:57.460 --> 00:00:59.260
I'm going to use some shears here.

17
00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:02.700
You can definitely have your butcher do this if you don't want to deal with the chicken,

18
00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:03.700
but it's so easy.

19
00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:07.140
I thought I would just show you how to do it in case you have a whole chicken and you'd

20
00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:08.980
like to dispatch it yourself.

21
00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:12.460
Basically, I'm just going to cut it through the backbone or next to the backbone, and

22
00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:14.540
then I'm going to cut it through the breast.

23
00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:16.540
The tail is going to be your guide.

24
00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:19.700
Just go to the tail and just cut along all the way in.

25
00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:20.700
Crunch.

26
00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:22.220
It's very satisfying that sound.

27
00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:24.900
Did you get it Milton?

28
00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:29.860
You could cut the backbone out entirely or you could leave it on depending on if you

29
00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:32.540
like that little nubby tail, which I actually really do.

30
00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:34.980
Or you could cut it off and then just use the backbone for stock.

31
00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:38.620
For this one, I'm going to cut it off just because it'll be a slightly neater presentation.

32
00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:42.300
I'm going to get it started with my knife and I'm going to go through the breast bone

33
00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:43.300
right here.

34
00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:44.300
It just makes it easier.

35
00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:45.300
There we go.

36
00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:48.300
I have a plastic bag in the freezer with my little chicken parts.

37
00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:49.780
When it gets filled up, I make stock.

38
00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:51.780
Let me wash my hands.

39
00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:52.780
Okay.

40
00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:56.260
It's a really straightforward marinade.

41
00:01:56.260 --> 00:02:00.460
This is the ahi amariyo yellow and this is the ahi panca.

42
00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:04.260
If you can't find it and you want to make this dish, you can substitute other chili

43
00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:05.260
pastes.

44
00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:06.860
You need a lot of garlic for this.

45
00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:08.500
This is six cloves of garlic.

46
00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:13.940
You can mince them or just grate them on a little microplane, lime juice for acidity,

47
00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:18.220
soy sauce, mustard, ground cumin, salt and pepper.

48
00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:19.220
Just give it a whisk.

49
00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:22.700
Then I'm just going to coat it really nicely.

50
00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:26.700
Get under the wings, but you don't have to worry about going under the skin.

51
00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:27.700
It's going to get there.

52
00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:28.700
Thank you.

53
00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:32.660
Put it in the fridge between two and 12 hours.

54
00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:36.420
You don't want to leave this for more than 12 hours because at that point the chicken

55
00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:38.980
is going to start to, the texture is going to be affected.

56
00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:41.780
It's going to start to get a little bit soft because of the acidity.

57
00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:44.060
So 12 hours is your max.

58
00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:49.740
What I want to do now is I want to pat it dry because the moisture is going to inhibit

59
00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:50.740
browning.

60
00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:56.100
Since this is really all about the burnished, gorgeous, crisp skin, if you don't pat it

61
00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:58.620
down, you're not going to get there.

62
00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:03.580
The chicken at this point has really absorbed all the good flavors of the marinade.

63
00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:05.580
Don't feel bad about patting it off.

64
00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:06.780
It has done its work.

65
00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:11.620
I'm just going to go wash my hands.

66
00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:13.180
This is just a little bit of olive oil.

67
00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:15.700
The olive oil is going to help crisp the skin.

68
00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:18.740
Just drizzle it on just a little.

69
00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:21.060
Now we're going to put it straight away in the oven.

70
00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:22.540
This is the thing.

71
00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:28.060
If you don't usually put your oven at 450 and your oven isn't pretty clean, you might

72
00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:29.060
notice some smoke.

73
00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:31.060
I'm just warning you.

74
00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:32.060
It's normal.

75
00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:35.140
So don't be alarmed if your oven gets a little smoky.

76
00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:37.940
That is the temperature you need.

77
00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:39.860
It's going to take about 35-45 minutes.

78
00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:45.020
If your oven is at all uneven, and actually most ovens are pretty uneven, halfway through

79
00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:47.660
cooking, just turn the tray around.

80
00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:50.060
That way it will brown evenly.

81
00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:52.740
So while the chicken is roasting, we can make the sauce.

82
00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:56.860
The sauce for this kind of chicken varies with the cook.

83
00:03:56.860 --> 00:03:59.420
There is no one kind of green sauce that goes with it.

84
00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:03.060
When I developed the recipe, I tried many different combinations and this was the one.

85
00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:05.340
I was like, yes, this is the sauce.

86
00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:09.540
So for all you cilantro haters out there, if you don't want to use cilantro, you can

87
00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:11.300
substitute another green.

88
00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:13.300
You just want to make sure it has a really fresh flavor.

89
00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:15.940
My new favorite cilantro substitute is arugula.

90
00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:19.500
Actually, baby arugula, because it has a peppery brightness.

91
00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:21.620
It's a different flavor, but I like it.

92
00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:27.660
There are so many things in the sauce, but they work together and they really harmonize

93
00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:28.660
well.

94
00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:33.180
So I'm going to get this going and then I'm going to slowly drizzle in the olive oil.

95
00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:47.980
How do you know when the sauce is blended enough?

96
00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:51.980
Well, one way is you look at it and you see that there are no big chunks.

97
00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:53.780
But another way to tell is you listen.

98
00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:59.100
You're going to hear the change from everything being solid, ingredients kind of bumping around

99
00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:03.700
until it gets quiet and like a little, like a purrs.

100
00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:05.820
When the blender purrs, your sauce is ready.

101
00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:07.020
It's bright green.

102
00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:08.980
It's very smooth and silky looking.

103
00:05:08.980 --> 00:05:10.620
So I'm going to try it.

104
00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:13.100
Oh, it's so good.

105
00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:15.140
You're tasting for salt and acidity.

106
00:05:15.140 --> 00:05:16.860
You add a little more salt, a little more pepper.

107
00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:19.940
I actually think this is perfect the way it is, so I'm not going to add any of it, but

108
00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:22.460
you need to taste it because you never know.

109
00:05:22.460 --> 00:05:23.460
And the chicken is ready.

110
00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:25.340
I'm going to get it and we're going to feast.

111
00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:29.060
Oh, it's gorgeous.

112
00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:30.060
You can see the color.

113
00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:34.900
Look at that, the crisp skin, the beautiful, really dark golden brown.

114
00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:39.460
Now you want to let it rest for a couple of minutes, just like five, 10 minutes tops while

115
00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:43.980
you set the table, pour the sauce into a bowl, get everything all ready.

116
00:05:43.980 --> 00:05:44.980
It doesn't need a long rest.

117
00:05:44.980 --> 00:05:53.580
It doesn't need like a 20 minute turkey rest.

118
00:05:53.580 --> 00:05:54.580
It's so good.

119
00:05:54.580 --> 00:05:55.580
It's so flavorful.

120
00:05:55.580 --> 00:05:57.580
The meat is juicy.

121
00:05:57.580 --> 00:06:00.140
The skin is crisp.

122
00:06:00.140 --> 00:06:01.140
That sauce is amazing.

123
00:06:01.140 --> 00:06:02.660
I want it on everything.

124
00:06:02.660 --> 00:06:07.300
Bright, vibrant, pungent, salty, umami, all of the things.

125
00:06:07.300 --> 00:06:09.940

It's such a good recipe.

130
00:06:16.340 --> 00:06:17.340
Wow.

131
00:06:17.340 --> 00:06:19.340
If I do say so myself.

132
00:06:19.340 --> 00:06:20.860
You don't mind if I sit underneath this, do you?
