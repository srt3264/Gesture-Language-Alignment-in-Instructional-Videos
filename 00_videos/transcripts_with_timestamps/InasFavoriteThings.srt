00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.800
Hi everybody, I'm Ina Garten and you're here in my barn in East Hampton, New York.

2
00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:12.400
Have a very good time and don't forget the cocktails.

3
00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:21.120
Delicious! So today I'm going to show you around my kitchen. Well, it's my office really and I'm

4
00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:25.600
going to show you a few of my favorite things. This barn is actually a great luxury for me because I

5
00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:31.840
used to work and film in my house. That was crazy and so now I get to walk across the lawn

6
00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:36.080
and go to work and then when I'm done I can close the door and leave work behind me.

7
00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:43.680
One of the things I do in my kitchen to make everything really simple is I don't have a

8
00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:48.240
lot of fancy equipment. I have just things that anybody else would have in their kitchen.

9
00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:52.640
Maybe a few more but not a lot. Nothing that anybody can have themselves. I'm going to start

10
00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:57.040
with three things on the counter that I like to have out all the time. First because they're better

11
00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:02.400
at room temperature like garlic and oranges, eggs are better at room temperature on baking,

12
00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:06.560
and lemons are better at room temperature because they have more juice. I'm always picking up something

13
00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:12.160
and stirring or tasting something and I just buy antique silver spoons. They're really inexpensive

14
00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:17.120
and I just put them in a jar and leave them on the counter. A few spatulas. And the third thing is

15
00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:21.440
butcher blocks. They're really important. I have lots of them and if you take care of them they last

16
00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:26.320
forever. Two years ago when I thought about writing a cookbook that was going to come out in October

17
00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:30.720
of 2020, I thought well there's going to be an election in November and everybody's going to be

18
00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:35.440
stressed so I'm going to write a cookbook about comfort food and I thought well modern comfort

19
00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:40.400
food would be great because it's fresher, it's easier to make, it's kind of more delicious.

20
00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:45.920
Little did I know. Turns out we all needed this right now. So Thanksgiving is actually usually

21
00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:50.240
in the barn at this big long table but this year's going to be really different. It's going to be

22
00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:55.040
Jeffrey and me in quarantine. I'll probably make a very small turkey and I think we're going to have

23
00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:59.600
a very good time. Okay now I'm going to take you to the stove and I'm going to show you four things

24
00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:04.160
that I absolutely adore. The first thing's salt. I have three salts that I use all the time. First

25
00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:09.600
one's kosher salt and I use diamond crystal kosher salt. It's actually different from other

26
00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:13.920
kosher salt. Some of them are much saltier and so you have to be careful if you use a different

27
00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:19.440
kind. The second one is French sea salt. It's called fleur de sel. I use it to finish things.

28
00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:25.760
It's kind of just lightly briny and the third one I use from time to time is mold and flake sea salt

29
00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:30.960
and what I like is when I'm doing like a pastry crust like a chicken pot pie or something I'll

30
00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:36.320
brush it with egg wash and just sprinkle it with salt and pepper and that flake salt just looks

31
00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:42.560
gorgeous and that crunchiness tastes great. So three salts I always use and then these are really

32
00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:47.040
important. Timers. I have lots of timers. I don't want to put something in the oven and forget about

33
00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:53.120
it which I can do and the next thing is I have lots of oven thermometers because no matter what

34
00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:58.320
it says on the dial the oven itself could be totally different. Okay now I'm going to give you a

35
00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:02.560
little tour of the pantry. I have food on one side and I have equipment on the other side. I'll show

36
00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:13.040
you. Oh I forgot I have to stop. So this is all the equipment and look who's a Dutch ovens and

37
00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:19.680
dishes that I use a lot and big pans, knife sharpeners, everything you need and then this is the

38
00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:24.240
pantry side. This is all the food. It's not the neatest pantry in the world but it's not the worst.

39
00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:29.920
Okay I'm back. Let me show you some things over here that I love. One is my kitchen scale. I use

40
00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:35.840
it all the time. So if something says five ounces and you want it to be really five ounces it's really

41
00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:41.040
helpful to have a kitchen scale so that's a good one. Not very expensive and you can buy them anywhere.

42
00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:46.160
The next thing I love and this is maybe not something everybody has is a food meal and what I

43
00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:51.280
like is something ends up with texture so it's not just like baby food. Potatoes I actually like

44
00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:57.520
finely pureed so that's different. Okay that's my food meal. I just adore it and two things for

45
00:03:57.520 --> 00:04:04.240
easy cleanup. One is parchment paper and I love to line sheet pans with parchment paper so that

46
00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:07.760
all you have to do is throw the paper out and you've got a nice clean pan. Well you have to put

47
00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:12.400
it in the dishwasher but it's not like crusty and this is the other cleanup thing that I adore

48
00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:18.320
which is my wrap and snap. Instead of fighting with that box all you do is just pull this out

49
00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:25.280
really simply just cut it off and you have a really simple piece of plastic wrap. I use it all the

50
00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:29.840
time. It's just great. Okay I've got one more thing to show you. Actually I've got two more things to

51
00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:35.040
show you. First I'm going to show you this and it's not for ice cream. What I do is I use this

52
00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:40.720
just a regular ice cream scoop for muffins, for meatballs, for anything that's round and shaped

53
00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:46.960
like that and it makes perfectly proportioned meatballs and muffins and it looks very professional.

54
00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:51.440
It's just an ice cream scoop you can buy in the homeware store. Okay one more thing and it's my

55
00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:59.200
favorite thing in the kitchen. I'll be right back. And I'm looking for good vanilla, homemade vanilla.

56
00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:06.320
This is just what I'm looking for. Might tell you about this. Okay this is it. This is my homemade

57
00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:12.160
vanilla. This has been going for 35 years. What I did was I took a jar and I put vanilla beans in it.

58
00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:16.480
They're expensive but you don't have to do it very often and then I poured in vodka. You use

59
00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:23.680
very inexpensive vodka. It's no time for grey goose and I filled the jar with vanilla and vodka and

60
00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:29.920
the liquid after about four or six months becomes vanilla extract and the smell is just amazing.

61
00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:36.320
And also the vanilla beans, the seeds inside become liquid so you just snip off the top and you squeeze

62
00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:41.040
the beans out. So if you're making something that like a vanilla pudding or a vanilla cake,

63
00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:45.920
you can see the seeds in it and it just is so flavorful. It's like that kind of bitter thing

64
00:05:45.920 --> 00:05:51.360
that's great with something sweet. So that's my vanilla and it's really easy to make. Merry Christmas

65
00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:56.480
gift. Okay that's a tour of my kitchen. I know this is going to be unusual Thanksgiving but I think

66
00:05:56.480 --> 00:06:01.920
it's important to find joy in the small things, the simple things and to make it a real celebration

67
00:06:01.920 --> 00:06:07.920
because the holidays really kind of mark important dates and if we lose that we'll lose the whole thing

68
00:06:07.920 --> 00:06:13.760
and so have a wonderful Thanksgiving. Cook a lot, share with everybody and have a very good time.

69
00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:15.680
Happy Thanksgiving everybody.

70
00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:24.160
Is that all right? That was so great. Okay good.
